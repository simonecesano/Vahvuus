Using Vahvuus
=============

Vahvuus makes it easy to navigate the new Design servers and to make the
best use their fantastic capabilities, like sharing, versioning,
searching and much more.

You probably will want to check out our quick introduction to the key concepts on the
new servers [here]([% c.uri_for('/help/versioning') %]). The workflow
is not complicated at all once you get the hang of it, but there are a few
things to keep in mind when switching from a "dumb" filesystem, so
take 2 minutes and check it out. It won't take more, and you'll soon
be a ninja.

If ninja is not enough for you, there's also a "more than you probably want to know" explanation
[here]([% c.uri_for('/help/technical') %]). After reading that you'll
probably explaining things to us, and not the other way round.

Oh, and just in case you wanted to know Vahvuus comes from the Finnish work for
"strength". We got it from Google translate, not from a branding agency.

Navigating
-------------

If you can use the Finder, or Windows Explorer you probably can use
the navigation in Vahvuus. Click on any of the sub-folders listed
under the "Subfolders" heading to navigate to the folder.

You can also clock on any one of the folders on the folder path listing under the
title to jump to  any spot on the path.

If you get badly lost, you can click on the "Actions" menu, and choose
the first item - "Go to the root folder". That will take you back to
the root of the folder tree.

You can do the same also by clicking on the little folder icon at the
left of the folder path listing.

<b>The following feature is not implemented yet. This is how it will work when it
does.</b>

You can open any of the files in the files listing by clicking on
it. In some cases (images, PDF or AI files) you will be able to see
the content directly in the browser.

This only works with files that are smaller than 7Mb. If you want
to see bigger files, you need to sync them to your computer: this
is because downloading big files this way really slows things
down. Syncing, instead, is lightning fast. 

Creating folders
----------------

<b>This feature is not implemented yet. This is how it will work when it
does.</b>

If you want to create a sub-folder in the folder you are in, choose
"Create a folder here" in the "Actions" menu. A popup will show, and
ask you for the folder name. You obviously cannot choose a name of an
existing folder, and there are a few characters you cannot use.

Other than that, click OK, and you will be taken to the folder you
just created.

Uploading files
---------------

<b>This feature is not implemented yet. This is how it will work when it
does.</b>

You can upload a file directly into the folder you are in. To do that,
choose "Upload a file here" in the "Actions" menu. A popup will show,
and you can drag and drop your file onto the grey area, or choose a file to
upload by clocking "Browse". Once you're done choosing the file, click
OK to upload, and wait until it's done. The page will refresh, and
your file will be there. In case things do not work out, you'll get an
error message telling you what happened.

If you're trying to upload a file which has the same name of an
existing one, this will be saved as a new version of the old one,
which will be kept. However, you may not be allowed to do so: it could be that
someone is working on the file, or it is locked. You can tell that's
the case because the file name field is highlighted, and an error
message below tells you what's going on, and (in case) who's locking
the file, so you can call or e-mail them about it.

There's a limit to the file size you can upload - it's 20Mb. things
get so slow beyond that size that it's not the best idea. Syncing the
folder, adding the file there and checking it in is going to be
faster, and lets you keep things aligned really easily.
